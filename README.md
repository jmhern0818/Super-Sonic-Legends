Sir you have been found with Rocket League hacks. 
A SWAT team is on the way to your location. Make sure the door is open, otherwise they are ready to break it down. 
Don't destroy any evidence and don't contact your accomplices! 
Prepare disks, flash drives and any other multimedia devices containing illegal materials, proving your criminality. 
Be prepared to answer the questions during your interrogation! Cooperate and don't deny the charges against you.
